# DOOR-LOCK-SYSTEM-USING-IOT
    The Door Lock System in Iot is an intelligent, technology-driven security 
solution that utilizes an Arduino microcontroller to manage access control 
through a keypad-based password system. As modern security demands 
continue to rise, traditional locking systems such as mechanical locks are no 
longer sufficient in providing the level of protection and convenience required 
in contemporary homes and small office environments. This project addresses 
these concerns by introducing a cost-effective, customizable, and easy-to- 
implement electronic locking system that enhances physical security while 
minimizing complexity. The core of the system revolves around the Arduino 
Uno, which is programmed to detect user input from a 4x4 matrix keypad and 
compare it with a pre-defined password stored in the microcontroller's 
memory. Upon correct entry, the Arduino triggers a servo motor to rotate and 
simulate the unlocking of a door. To enhance user interaction, an LCD display 
is used to show system messages such as "Enter Password", "Access Granted", 
or "Access Denied", providing immediate visual feedback. Additionally, a 
buzzer is integrated into the circuit to offer audio alerts in the event of incorrect 
entries, further reinforcing the systemâ€™s interactivity and reliability. This 
system demonstrates how Iot principles and embedded systems can be 
integrated to develop a standalone smart lock that operates independently 
without requiring an internet connection, yet remains modular enough to be 
extended with IoT features like mobile alerts or remote access. It also offers 
the flexibility to update passwords directly through code, which can later be 
upgraded into a dynamic password management feature using wireless 
connectivity. The design is simple, energy- efficient, and constructed using 
readily available components, making it ideal for educational purposes and 
small-scale real-world applications.
